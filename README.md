# Welcome to the Rebel browser!

Rebel aims to be an easily brandable fork of Chromium.

To brand Chromium today, there are thousands of source and build configuration changes to be made. Rebel's goal is to serve as an intermediate fork of Chromium, allowing downstream forks to create a fully branded browser with only a handful of build arguments.

# Building Rebel

Check out the [Rebel Wiki](https://github.com/RebelBrowser/rebel/wiki) for instructions on building and re-branding Rebel, and for documentation on how we've changed upstream Chromium.
